# LearnPolars
A Repository for Polars Study Materials


- Polars Cheat Sheet is a jupyter notebook with common polars transformations and patterns to help beginner users of polars learn it.
- The Polars Anki Deck is a flashcard deck ready to be used with the spaced repitition software, [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).
- CSV files provide the data for the polars cheat sheet


I will continue to update these files as I learn more about polars while I use it for my daily work.
